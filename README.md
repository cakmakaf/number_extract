# Number Extraction

We gave a method of how could numbers be extracted from a list of strings.

## Project Description

In this file, assume that we have list of strings such as

{"321","ahmet","1983ah","25","python"}

We will extract only the numbers out of this list

## Execution

To execute the program, you need to have Python 3.x and an editor. If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.X installer and not the Python 2.7 installer.
